# Union Source Generator

Union Source Generator is a C# source generator that generates a union type for a set of types. The generated union type can hold any _one_ of the specified types.
Consuming the type can be done by _exhaustive_ pattern matching.

The main component is one *generic attribute*, `UnionAttribute`, which is used to specify the types that the union can hold, on a `struct`:

```csharp
[Union<Result<int>, NotFound>]
public readonly partial struct SimpleObj;
```

This will result in a generated `SimpleObj` type that can hold any of the specified types, *but only one at a time*.
It also provides compile time checked _exhaustive_ `Switch` and `Match` methods to handle the different types.
Implicit conversions operators are generated as well as equality members.

```csharp
SimpleObj simple = CreateSimple();
simple.Switch(
              r =>  Console.WriteLine($"Found: {r}"),
              _ => Console.WriteLine("not found"));
int result = simple.Match(r => r.Value * 2,
                          _ => -1);

SimpleObj CreateSimple() => new NotFound();
```

## Opinionated Naming Scheme 

This library is *opinionated* as it will try to assign '_readable_' names to the properties based on the specified types:

```csharp
SimpleObj simple = new SimpleObj(new Result<int>(12));
bool found = simple.IsNotFound;
Result<int> result = simple.AsResultOfInt32();
```

It even will try to detect collections and assign names like `ListOfFoo` or `DictionaryOfStringAndInt64`.

The same is true for the lambda parameter names in the `Match` & `Switch` methods.
For `Switch` they will get names like `forString` (or `forNone`) and for `Match` ones like `withString` (or `withNone`).

That can work great in many scenarios but will probably lead to bad naming in some cases - that's the trade-off I'm willing to accept.

## Union Object Size

We try to be smart and use as little memory as possible for the union object.

- They are `readonly struct`s
- Only those fields actually needed are generated
  - e.g. only a single reference field which is used for all reference types
  - if there are not reference types, no reference field is generated
  - if there are no value types, no value field is generated
- The fields of the value types are stored at the same offset
  - That is safe, because only one of those will ever be set and the values are `readonly`
- A single `byte` is used for storing the state so that they union object knows _what_ it is

So the _minimal_ size is 3 bytes (1 for state, 1 for each of the two min. required types) and the _maximal_ size is 9 bytes (1 for state and 8 for the reference type) + the size of the largest value type.
Plus padding for alignment (see below).

> We assume 8 bytes for reference types, so 32bit targets waste some space and larger pointer sizes *explicit* alignment configuration is required!

### Alignment

There is always a little trade-off between memory and performance.
Usually, especially since we use `readonly` structs, it is better to sacrifice a few bytes to getter better alignment of the fields.

> As far as I know it is not possible to get the size of a type at compile time, so we cannot automatically make the optimal decision here.

Alignment can be configured for each union type individually by passing one of the `UnionAlignment` `enum` values to the attributes constructor like so:

```csharp
[Union<Result<int>, NotFound>(UnionAlignment.Aligned8)]
public readonly partial struct Foo;
```

At this point there are four options:

- `Unaligned`: No padding is added to the state field
  - A reference type still gets 8 bytes at the beginning of the struct
  - Value type fields are placed directly after the state field - this will result in those being misaligned in most cases, but no space is wasted
- `Aligned4`: The state field is followed by 3 bytes of padding
  - This is *the default*, hopefully a good compromise
  - A reference type still gets 8 bytes at the beginning of the struct
- `Aligned8`: The state field is followed by 7 bytes of padding
  - A reference type still gets 8 bytes at the beginning of the struct
  - This setting should work well for 64bit targets, but wastes quite a bit of space
- `Aligned16`: The state field is followed by 15 bytes of padding
  - A reference type still _also_ gets 16 bytes at the beginning of the struct
    - In case you have a special system with 16 byte pointers, this can be used to reserve enough space 
  - This setting might be useful for SIMD scenarios or other special cases

I ran several benchmarks and for most scenarios, modern CPUs and runtime it doesn't matter too much anyway - but, you can use this to optimize based on your knowledge of the types used.

And, of course, at the end of the struct the runtime will probably pad to the next 8 byte boundary as well - as usual.

## Motivation

My main motivation was to finally learn more about writing source generators by creating one myself.
I haven't found a lot of resources regarding _generic_ marker attributes in combination with source generators, so I'm not sure my approach is optimal, but maybe it can serve as a starting point for others.

As a first project I wanted something with a small scope and I was always a little annoyed by the property names (`T0`, `T1`, ...) in the `OneOf` library (which they have to use due to the types being generic -- even when using their source generator).
So this is what I decided to tackle.

## Quality

This is a two-day toy project without much testing (and no serious automated tests).
I will probably use it in my own projects in the future to see how far I'll get and fix issues as they arise.

Feedback (and PRs ðŸ˜‰) to make the implementation more robust, efficient and generally better are welcome, of course!
